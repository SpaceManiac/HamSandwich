SPOOKY CASTLE SOURCE CODE LICENSE

The Spooky Castle source code is provided AS-IS, and you use it at your own risk.  If it blows up your
computer, that's your problem.

You may use the source code for any legal purpose.  It would be nice to give credit to Hamumu Software
if you did, but it's not required.

THE MUSIC, GRAPHICS, AND SOUND EFFECTS ARE NOT FREE TO USE.  They are copyrighted by Hamumu Software
and you may not distribute them in any way.  This includes the music, graphics, and sound effects contained in
the demo version of the game.  If you wish to create something using this source code, you must create your 
own graphics, sound, and music, or distribute an EXE that people who already own the game or have the demo
can use.

YOU MAY NOT DISTRIBUTE THE MUSIC, GRAPHICS, AND SOUND EFFECTS OF SPOOKY CASTLE, INCLUDING THOSE INCLUDED IN THE DEMO.

The demo may be distributed freely, but only in full unmodified form, without added files.

	// basics
	"Press F1 any time to get help with any menu or tool. "
	"^ ^ Basic Editor Usage: ^ ^ "
	"Click and hold on the top left button (where it says "
	"'Floor') to get the list of tools. Click and hold the "
	"'Menus' button to get the list of menus. You can scroll "
	"the screen with the arrow keys, or by moving the mouse "
	"to the screen edge.",
	// floor tool
	"Click on any of the four floor tiles to select one to "
	"be active.  Right-click on any of them to choose a new "
	"tile to replace it.  Left or right click on 'Brush' to "
	"change the brush size.  Click anywhere on the map to "
	"'paint' your new floor tiles on. ^ 'Plop' controls how "
	"the four different tiles are used. See the manual for "
	"details on the different plop modes. 'Normal' will plop "
	"down only the active tile and is the most useful.",
	// wall tool
	"Click on any of the four walls to select one to be active. "
	"Right-click on the top half of any of them to change the "
	"roof for it, or the bottom half to change the wall.  Left "
	"or right click on 'Brush' to change the brush size.  Click "
	"anywhere on the map to paint your walls on.  'Plop' controls "
	"how the four different walls are used - check the manual "
	"for details on what the different plop modes mean.",
	// item tool
	"Click on any of the four items to select one to be active. "
	"Right-click on an item to choose a new item to replace it. "
	"Left or right click on 'Brush' to change the brush size. "
	"Click anywhere on the map to paint your new items on. 'Plop' "
	"controls how the four items are used.  See the manual for "
	"details.  Or just leave it on Normal and don't think about it!",
	// badguy tool
	"Click on any of the four monster names to select one to be "
	"active.  Right click them to choose new monsters. Left or "
	"right click on 'Brush' to change the brush size. Click anywhere "
	"on the map to plant your monsters.  There is a limit of 128 "
	"monsters on each level - That's not as many as you think! "
	"^ Left click on the item box to cycle through: No Item, Random Item, "
	"Specific Item.  Whatever it is on, that's what the monsters will "
	"drop when defeated. Right click on it to select a specific item.",
	// light tool
	"Click 'Plop' to select what the cursor should do: ^ ^ "
	"Solid - set tiles immediately to the chosen Bright value. ^ "
	"Fade - move tiles towards the chosen Bright value by one notch. ^ "
	"Torch - make a blob of light. Bright affects how big and bright. ^ "
	"Smooth - smooths the light differences between neighboring tiles. ^ ^ "
	"Random allows you to add randomness to the Bright value. If you "
	"turn on Line Of Sight, the tool won't pass through walls.",
	// special tool
	"This one is special!  Click anywhere on the map to place a Special, and "
	"start up the Special editor to define what it does.  Clicking on an "
	"existing Special will edit it.  You can right click Specials to delete them.",
	// select tool
	"All the other tools will only function on tiles that are selected. "
	"By default, every tile is selected. Click on the map to select or "
	"unselect tiles.  Plop chooses whether you want to Toggle the "
	"selection of tiles, always Select, or always Unselect. "
	"Show sets how it displays which tiles are selected. "
	"Select None unselects all tiles, then changes to Select All. "
	"Copy Selection pastes a copy of the selected area where you choose, "
	"and Swap Selection is similar, but puts the target area where your "
	"selection was.",
	// eraser tool
	"The simplest tool of all!  It just erases what you click on.  The "
	"checkboxes let you limit what it will erase.  For instance if you "
	"only want to remove monsters, uncheck everything but 'Badguy'. Erasing "
	"lights means setting the light level to zero. Erasing Walls just flattens "
	"them, leaving their roof tile as the floor.",
	// item edit menu
	"Be careful when editing an item - any changes you make will affect all "
	"copies of that item in your entire world.  If you want a variant of an "
	"existing item without changing the original, click on 'Copy Item', then make "
	"your changes to the copy.  Any custom-made items will be in the Extras "
	"category.  If you mess up one of the original items, click 'Reset Item' to "
	"restore it to normal.  Overall, editing an item is more complicated than we "
	"can explain here, so read the manual!",
	// item picker
	"You're picking an Item now.  Not a difficult task - just click on a "
	"category at the top and you'll see a list of all items in that category "
	"down the left side.  Click on the one you want!  If there are more items "
	"than will fit in the list, a \"More Items...\" button will be present. "
	"You can also click Exit to not pick an item.",
	// monster picker
	"Easy as pie: just click on a category at the top of the screen, and a list "
	"of monsters that fit that category will appear down the left side of the screen. "
	"Click on the one you want, or click 'More Monsters' to see more. "
	"If you've scanned that monster, you'll see a description of it in the middle of the "
	"screen.  If the description begins with the word \"(bby)\", that "
	"means that this monster creates other monsters. "
	"This is important because if a monster drops a specific item, ALL of the "
	"monsters it creates will drop the same item!",
	// sound edit
	"Click 'Add New Sound' to put your own custom sound in.  This lets you choose "
	"from any WAV files which are in the 'user' folder.  Then give it a name.  The "
	"name is just for your use so you recognize it when editing.  You can delete any "
	"sound you create, rename it, or reload it.  Reload means to load a new wav file "
	"to replace the one you already had.  The sounds you add are saved into the DLW "
	"file, so don't need to be included separately.  You can't rename, delete, or "
	"reload any of the original sounds.",
	// sound pick
	"Click a category on the left side, and the sound effects in that category "
	"will be listed on the right.  Right click any sound effect to hear it, and "
	"left click to select it!  Any sounds you added yourself will be in the Custom "
	"Sounds category.",
	// special editor
	"You'll have to read the manual to get good info on how to create Specials! "
	"But hold the mouse button on a 'Select' box to get the list of Triggers or "
	"Effects and pick one.  Then set the values for it by clicking or right "
	"clicking the various boxes.  Many buttons will work in different ways when "
	"right clicked versus left clicking.  Learn what each does!  You can right "
	"click the '# of Uses' button to set it to Unlimited.",
	// terrain edit
	"Click on a tile to select it, or drag to select multiple.  Click checkboxes to "
	"assign flags to the terrain.  The specifics of each flag are explained in the "
	"manual. Click on Next Tile to set which tile this tile becomes when it animates, "
	"is pushed, etc.  If you select a group of tiles, you can click Make Tile Loop or "
	"Make Rvrs Loop to set the Next Tile of each one in the group to the one following "
	"it.  Delete Unused Tiles deletes all tiles that aren't used anywhere in your world, "
	"making your DLW file smaller.  Click Next Page to see more tiles.",
	// tile picking
	"Just click on any tile to select it!  Click Next Page to see more tiles.",
	// world stitcher
	"",
	// item JSP
	"To use this option, add a Special to your hub level with the Item Sprites effect. "
	"It can use JSP files in the 'user' folder. For best results, use a single JSP file "
	"containing every custom item sprite for your world.",

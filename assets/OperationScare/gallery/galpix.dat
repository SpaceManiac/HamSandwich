adam.bmp,Adam,TDM,144,46,"TDM sez: ""The inspiration for this picture was Frankenstein. I thought it would be interesting to put together a composite of various monsters. But Frankenstein wasn't contemporary enough, and his body parts were human. One of the story lines in ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" is a monster named Adam. He was created from body parts from various demons, therefore my creation became Adam.  I knew which monster I wanted as my base, Super Duper Zombie. Then I decided what other monsters I wanted to use for parts. I think you'll recognize most of them, but I want to make clear that half of the face is NOT Bouapha it's his evil clone. And the no heart symbol is supposed to represent that the monster neither literally or figuratively has a heart. This took considerable time to do because I had to cut, resize, paste, and touch-up each new part I added to the monster."""
alien_taxi.bmp,Off To Work,Hamumu,122,58,"I like to draw aliens, I think.  This one is on his way to work.  Doesn't this totally look like a Commander Mark picture with all the angles?  Ah... if only you knew what I was talking about.  You'd laugh!  You ever notice how aliens always use a lot of triangles?  Me too."
bath.bmp,Morning Ritual,TDM,147,46,"TDM sez: ""Various people have asked questions like: ""Where does Bouapha live?"", ""Does he have a sister?"". So I thought it would be fun to create an environment that we're all familiar with, getting ready in the morning.  I copied Bouapha and retouched him. Did you notice the butterfly tattoo? The sink and commode are clip-art. I copied the boots, pants, and shirt; and placed them around on the floor where he also drops his towels! He's kind of a slob!  This picture was complicated because he was standing at an angle looking into the mirror, so it took me around 10 hours to put it together."""
beefy_carrot.bmp,Beefy Carrot,Hamumu,122,54,"Most of my doodles, I don't know what I'm doing until I'm about half done.  This one seems to be a heavily armed pink bunny.  The pinkness (and all the other colors) are courtesy of Sol Hunt, who colored this picture.  I rarely color things, I can't stay in the lines.  For some reason, this mighty weapon is called the Beefy Carrot.  It sounded right."
berthagal.bmp,"Bertha, The Dr. Lunatic Gal",Lisa Dash,150,46,"One of the Dr. Lunatic art contest entries was this!  And many more pictures like it.  Lisa Dash poses here as Bertha, the Dr. Lunatic Gal.  She thought it was biased that Bouapha was the hero and had no female counterpart.  Guess she hasn't heard of Bouaphetta!"
blimp.bmp,Das Blimp,Hamumu,122,50,"I often doodle sharp angles and various curves.  Then I just sorta put them together to make what they seem to suggest.  Here, that was a high tech blimp.  Not much else to it!"
bumpersticker.bmp,Bumper Sticker,Lisa Dash,144,49,"This is another of Lisa Dash's entries in the Dr. Lunatic art contest.  It's a design for a bumper sticker.  And it's a funny one!  She won the Grand Prize with this entry, because it was just our favorite overall."
cookies.bmp,Lunatic Cookies,Lisa Dash,147,49,Lisa Dash submitted this to the Dr. Lunatic art contest (one of many entries of hers!).  It's cookies!
crabby_patty.bmp,Crabby Patty Concept,Hamumu,103,48,"This was the original design concept for the undersea boss, Crabby Patty.  Not quite how she turned out.  The coloring was done after the fact, on the computer, by Sol Hunt.  All my concept drawings (on the rare occasions I actually do any!) are always just pencil or pen on paper."
cross_stitch.bmp,Bouapha Cross-Stitch,Lisa Dash,150,49,"This is a cross-stitch pattern submitted for the Dr. Lunatic Art Contest by Lisa Dash.  There's more to it - like any cross-stitch pattern, it includes references for which thread colors to use and all, but you can get the gist here, and it's not like you could stitch it right on your monitor!"
crumble.bmp,Get Ready To Crumble,SpiderPumpkin,144,52,"An entry in the Dr. Lunatic art contest, by Spiderpumpkin.  Pretty self-explanatory, but funny.  We really wanted to give Spiderpumpkin a prize for this entry and his other one, but he was just edged out by a different competitor.  We felt bad, because they're both awesome!"
dance.bmp,Lord Of The Dance,TDM,147,52,"TDM sez: ""The inspiration for this picture is the fact that I like ballet. We see Bouapha out and about working ever so hard at saving his world by defeating various monsters, so I thought it might be nice to see a more whimsical side of him dancing in a flowered meadow with garland on his head and a tutu!  I copied Bouapha, did some cutting, pasting, and drawing to get the pose I wanted. I created the rest of the picture myself, except for the butterflies. It took me a couple of hours to complete it."""
dozer.bmp,Dozer The Dozerian Concept,Hamumu,107,48,"This is the concept design for Dozer The Dozerian.  As you can see, he turned out just about as advertised!  There's also notes on here about how his weapons function - the series of circles in front of him is the spread pattern of his energy grenades.  The hard-to-read text discusses how his machine gun fires (though in the final version, the machine gun is not present until you destroy his arms)."
drummer.bmp,Drummer Boy,Hamumu,127,50,"We were lounging around watching TV, and I asked for something to draw, and Sol Hunt told me to draw a drummer boy.  This is the result!"
eviltree.bmp,Terror Tree,Hamumu,106,45,"This is a detailed rendering of a Terror Tree from Loonyland.  It was created for making the CD graphics (and scaled down to show you here!).  The red glow effect is actually done with a series of spotlights, but also a pair of semi-transparent spheres which spin around, making that black and red color appear to be swirling.  It's actually more spinning than swirling though."
fishbowl.bmp,"Behold, Fish",Hamumu,122,62,"I was trying abnormally fat fish one day, and expanded one into this much more extensive picture.  Sol Hunt did the coloring, with colored pencil, though it looks better in person - reducing the colors on the computer resulted in the strangely grey finger.  This picture is inspired by Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling!"
happytime_friends.bmp,Happy Time Friends,Hamumu,122,66,"This is a great example of what happens when I doodle (the sharp text was done on the computer afterwards - it replaces handwritten text that was too faded too read).  Although this is funnier than usual, it's still typical: a bunch of little critters of various sorts (mostly created by starting with a random pencil line - several of which remained random pencil lines thereafter too!), and one large picture which gradually took shape and developed a theme of its own.  I think it's a funny theme.  On his chest it says ""Happy Time Friends"" circled around a smiley face.  Call them up for your next party!  Also, what's up with that PillBoy?"
haunted.bmp,Haunted House,Hamumu,122,69,"A picture of a haunted house I drew, and Sol Hunt colored.  Not that haunted-looking, really.  But at least it's in disrepair."
hitchhiker.bmp,The Hitchhiker,TDM,150,52,"TDM sez: ""I'm not sure what inspired me for this picture - it just sort of popped into my head.  I used one of the frames from the desert movie. I added the cacti, the road, the setting sun, created the hitchhiking thumb/arm, and created the where-to sign. I originally wanted a car with a couple of zombies cruising down the highway, but that was a little more than I was capable of drawing. Besides I thought it might make the picture too busy.  This took me several hours to complete."""
kidloony.bmp,Kid Loony,Hamumu,103,45,"Dr. Lunatic as a young kid, with a slingshot... from Loonyland!  This is actually the picture used on the Loonyland CD (composited with a ton of other things), that's why he looks so scared... an army of monsters is coming right at him!"
lion.bmp,L Is For Lion,Hamumu,119,69,"A lion.  Drawn in Paint Shop Pro, for a little alphabet game for my nephew.  As of this writing, however, the game is unfinished.  Sounds like Hamumu to me!"
lisacharas.bmp,Lisa's Characters,Lisa Dash,144,55,"These are an assortment of proposed characters for Dr. Lunatic, by Lisa Dash.  She says she thinks they're appropriate for this day and age.  I guess so!"
mailboxer.bmp,Mailboxer Concept,Hamumu,111,48,"This is the concept design for the Mailboxer monster.  Pretty close to how he actually turned out, though I did ditch the little shoes on the bottom.  I think that was probably wise, and not just laziness.  He looks very diabolical peeking out of that slot."
maps.bmp,"Design Garbage, Vol I",Hamumu,115,48,"I know this one's hard to see, but I wanted to share!  The part you can see best is actually a map for a Dr. Lunatic level.  It was used almost exactly as drawn, so better guess which one!  Hint: It's in a world you buy in Bones, Bats & Beyond.  There's also a bunch of numbers and words on here from designing the original version of Sol Hunt.  The other map partially visible at the bottom is The Cave, from Pygmy Island.  The lines crossing it are mine cart tracks."
marshjrsr.bmp,"Marshmallow Heads, Jr. & Sr.",TDM,147,55,"TDM sez: ""One of Mike's aliases is Marshmallow Head, so I thought it would be fun to create a Marshmallow Head and put Mike's picture into my picture. The best way I thought to do that was to have it as though his picture was hanging on a wall.  I copied Mike's picture off his website. I then created the windows (and the view outside through the windows), the marshmallow border, and of course Marshmallow head.  This took me a few hours to complete."""
mayor.bmp,The Mayor Concept,Hamumu,103,51,"This is concept art that never went anywhere!  Originally, I envisioned this guy as the boss of the Urban levels.  He's simply called The Mayor, and he has a rocket launcher on his back.  The concept seemed striking at the time, but I ended up going with the monster I did because I wanted something huge and monstrous, like Matilda, rather than another small boss like the Countess.  This was colored on the computer by Sol Hunt."
nazi_penguin.bmp,Top Secret Nazi Experiment,Hamumu,119,66,"Apparently, during WWII, the Nazis were developing one last ultimate weapon in secret.  So secret, in fact, that nobody knew what it did, not even those who built it.  This is the Nazi Robot Penguin.  Note how it lacks any method of locomotion (in fact, it's bolted to the floor) and has no apparent weapons.  This is just another doodle of mine that started out as some shapes, and then went from there.  I had no idea it would become what it did.  Whatever that is.  Like several other pictures, it was colored by Sol Hunt, using colored pencils."
noprepare.bmp,Nothing Can Prepare You,Hamumu,119,62,"This picture was made for the ill-fated Mucho Kombat Vs. SPISPOPD.  Like everything else in that game, it's a spoof of Mortal Kombat (this spoofs the ads for the movie which said exactly that, only they featured a stone dragon in place of the cow)."
parrot.bmp,Linear Parrot,Hamumu,119,58,"Sol Hunt has a strange affinity for drawings made with just simple colored lines, nothing filled in.  So I made her this parrot.  She colored it."
piano.bmp,You Can Tune A Piano,TDM,150,55,"TDM sez: ""I wanted to dress Bouapha in a tuxedo to make him look classy.  I started with the black and white tiled floor, then decided to create the whole picture using almost entirely black, grey, and white. I copied Bouapha and created the tuxedo for him, the piano and fish is clip-art. Originally I had a champagne glass in his right hand, but my husband saw the picture and said, ""you can tune a piano, but you can't tuna fish."" After he said that, I decided to have Bouapha holding a fish, and use that for it's title.   This took several hours to complete."""
poem.bmp,Lisa's Poem,Lisa Dash,144,58,"Lisa Dash submitted this among many other things to the Dr. Lunatic art contest.  Technically, this is a screenshot of Word - you can tell by the purple dots under the date where Word would just love to insert the current date for me instead.  I really hate how Word thinks it knows everything."
powerarmor.bmp,Power Armor,Hamumu,112,41,"I don't recall what this was made for originally, but it is of course Bouapha in his Power Armor.  Those aren't donkey ears on top, they're metal fins that come up from the backpack.  Bouapha's Power Armor was modelled (sort of) after Mega Man, the Capcom video game hero - that's where those rounded arm cannons come from."
robosheep.bmp,Robosheep,Hamumu,119,54,"While chatting over the internet, I whipped up this sample of what a Robosheep might look like for a friend who in fact is making a game about a Robosheep.  It's drawn in Paint Shop Pro."
sneaky_shark.bmp,Sneaky Shark,Hamumu,112,59,"Rare footage of Sneaky Shark.  I drew this while modeling the treasure chest version of him to help me see how he should look.  It's obviously a very simple, primitive, badly done sketch, but it shows you the kind of thing I throw together just as part of the work process."
spaceship.bmp,A Spaceship,Hamumu,119,50,"I don't remember what this was for, but it's a spaceship.  It's related to SpaceBoy's spaceship (an unfinished game), but is not the same.  It's a rather flashy little hot rod though... looks like it's a Ferrari spaceship."
spisnews.bmp,Good Evening!,SpiderPumpkin,147,58,"Spiderpumpkin's entry in the art contest.  He says ""The countess was really bored of just guarding the haunted mansion, so she got a job at SPISPOPD News. This picture shows her greeting everyone who's watching the news with her good, old ""Good evening!"""""
squeezycheese.bmp,Squeezy Cheese,Master Jobee,150,58,"The winner of the Most Creative award in our Dr. Lunatic art contest: ""I designed this label to go on a can of Aerosol Cheese. I thought that if I was Bouapha, and I was on a mission far away from a fridge, I would want to have my 'Supreme With Cheese' power in a can of Aerosol Cheese so I could take it anywhere. The ingredients, other than the three extracts, are the real ingredients, and those are the real nutrition facts for the serving. Wacky Wizards, Buddy Bots, and Helpie Bots can also use this product. """
squiddo.bmp,Squiddo Concept,Hamumu,106,51,"Concept art of a critter that never made it into Supreme.  His name is Squiddo.  The idea was that he would shoot ink that would actually darken the area around you, making it very tough to tell what's going on.  I still think it's a cool idea.  A pencil sketch which Sol Hunt colored on the computer."
stockshirt.bmp,Stockboy Shirt,Hamumu,112,45,"This design was on the back of the T-shirt that people who beta-tested Stockboy received.  It shows off all the monsters from that game.  The text around it read ""I beta tested Stockboy"" on top, and ""Because I had nothing better to do."" on the bottom.  I think that's funny, and Sol wears her shirt regularly."
stockshirt2.bmp,Stockboy Shirt 2,Hamumu,115,45,"The front of the t-shirt given to people who beta-tested Stockboy had these two and the Stockboy catch-phrase (which appears nowhere except on this shirt and right here:) ""Clean up, Aisle 7."""
targetpractice.bmp,Target Practice,TDM,144,61,"TDM sez: ""My inspiration for this picture was the fact that I wanted to get Bouaphetta into a picture. I remembered the tale of William Tell, and how he shot an apple off someone's head with a crossbow (I think). So I thought it would be funny and fitting that Bouapha would have his sister place the apple on her head.  I copied Bouaphetta from the original Amazin' SPISPOPD game, and Bouapha from Dr. Lunatic. Then I just created the background scene.  It took a couple of hours to cut and paste the characters, plus another couple of hours to create the background."""
tomato.bmp,Modern Art F. Tomato,Hamumu,130,50,"This is what happens when you let me touch a paintbrush.  I'm no painter.  I doodled with it, and ended up with this odd assortment of... stuff.  I call it modern art!"
tree.bmp,Scribbly Tree,Hamumu,133,50,"A tree!  I drew this by copying a drawing in a book.  That's much easier than working from a photo or reality, since someone has already figured out where the lines go!"
wail.bmp,Wail Concept,Hamumu,109,51,Concept art of another undersea monster that didn't go in the game.  The Wail was a whale.  With a megaphone.  Get it?  This is a pencil drawing - the strange color is from Sol Hunt messing around on the computer.
wet_willy.bmp,Wet Willy Concept,Hamumu,112,51,"Wow, concept art that actually belongs to a creature that DID end up in the game.  This one got kind of munched up in the scanning process, so the smoothness is lost, but it's a pencil drawing like the others.  There was some thought of Odie (from the comic strip Garfield) in the design of this guy.  I think that's pretty apparent.  Copying Garfield (especially Odie) is where I developed all my cartooning style when I was young.  I think the googly eyes you find in all my games makes this obvious."
win_goth.bmp,Hooray For Goth Girl,Hamumu,136,50,"This is the victory screen from Stockboy, when you play as Goth Girl.  She's sullen."
win_happystick.bmp,Happy Stick Win,Hamumu,139,50,"Can't make a game without a member of the Happy Stick family in it!  Happy Stick Boy was in Stockboy, and this was the screen you'd see when he beat a level."
win_warpig.bmp,War Pig!,Hamumu,142,50,"In Stockboy, you could play as War Pig.  When you beat a level, you'd see this picture.  Note that he's flexing (is that clear enough in the picture, you think?).  I designed a game called War Pigs centered around this character and his allies.  It's a pretty darn cool idea.  Never made it though, except for a little demo where you could fly a helicopter over a landscape and pick up War Pigs and put them back down again.  When idle, they'd scratch their butt occasionally."
worldpkr.bmp,News Flash!,TDM,147,61,"TDM sez: ""My inspiration was the fact that a few people have mentioned that they like the world picker in Dr. Lunatic. I do too, so I decided to save it by creating a picture of it to put in the gallery. I didn't just want to copy the world; I thought it would be funny to have a character save it. One of the fans, RaisinJack, suggested a caped crusader Happy Stick Hero. So I borrowed his suggestion, and created it as the world saver.  This picture didn't take much time to create. I just copied the world, made a few stars and moon, drew the cape on Happy Stick Man, and placed him standing on a star. It took around an hour."""
zebra.bmp,Z Is For Zebra,Hamumu,127,54,This is a picture from an alphabet game I am making for my nephew.  I hope I finish it before he turns 23.  I'm pretty proud of this zebra though.
zombie.bmp,Braaains!,Hamumu,115,41,"A rendering of a Zombie.  I don't know what I did this for, but at one point I made a bunch of Dr. Lunatic renderings like this.  It may have been for Mark's Pants of Power website.  I don't recall!"
adv_comic1.bmp,Adventure Comics #1,Hamumu,130,54,The first episode of a long running comic series on our website!  Enthralling action and adventure!
adv_comic2.bmp,Adventure Comics #2,Hamumu,133,54,"This is the second and last episode ever made of Adventure Comics.  It was made years ago though.  Not much hope of ever finding out where the action-packed story will go!  But who knows.  And yes, it's supposed to be as dumb as it is.  It's all made up on the fly, dumb for the sake of dumb."
angelfish.bmp,Angelfishtank,Hamumu,136,54,"Sol Hunt really likes colorful 'linear art', so I painted this for her.  It desperately needs to be matted - hence all the wasted space around the outside!  The yellow was a very bad choice, it's almost invisible (in fact, it's much clearer in this picture than it is in person!)."
art_bear.bmp,Porridge Nap,Hamumu,139,54,Just a big picture I drew... my mom has it up in her house!  I'm famous!
boneless.bmp,Spaghetti Boneless,Hamumu,106,41,This is a terrifying villain from the game Sol Hunt.  Spaghetti Boneless!!
capncrook.bmp,Cap'n Crook,Hamumu,103,41,"The very first boss in Sol Hunt.  He was the boss of the only level I finished!  He's green because he gets spacesick, kind of unfortunate for a spaceship captain."
castle.bmp,Castle N' Doodles,Hamumu,142,54,"Another example of how I doodle.  A bunch of weird things, and a castle (there's also a martini jammed into one wall of the castle - that happens!).  There's a picture of Huzzah, my cat, here too.  He looks pretty dumb.  And a pickle!  And a caveman dragging his bride, another martini, and a collection of other assorted things."
cops.bmp,Collaborative Drawing,Hamumu,127,58,"This is something you should definitely do.  This is a terrible picture, I know.  But that's not the point!  This is a game you can play on road trips to pass the time: draw a little something (don't finish it, leave loose edges and things), then hand it off to someone else, who continues.  You end up with some really darn weird things going on.  Look at the leg that ended up as a lamp on a table which ended up as a graduation cap with an annoyed guy wearing it.  It's fun!"
cute_dragons.bmp,Cute Dragons,Hamumu,130,58,"An assortment of happy, cuddly dragons.  At the top, Sol Hunt quickly sketched one to give me an idea of what she thought I should do, and I loved the idea (sort of a Velveteen Dragon!), so the rest are my attempts to do something like that (well, not the winged ones, or the cheesy grin one, but it's all about happy dragons anyway).  The big white blocks are the result of these guys being pasted in from scattered positions all over a page."
doodles.bmp,Random Doodles,Hamumu,133,58,"This is me doodling with a thick pen.  You can see a guy inspired by the Dr. L pygmy here (this was drawn after Dr. L existed).  Also, I'm ashamed to admit this, but the big square-head guy is an attempt to draw the Professor from The Powerpuff Girls.  Yes, I know it doesn't even vaguely resemble him.  I was just trying it out (didn't have a source handy either!), since my weird round girl next to him reminded me of the Powerpuff Girls.  And I find his boxiness an interesting artistic notion."
dr_lunatic.bmp,Dr. Lunatic,Hamumu,115,51,"This is the drawing of Dr. Lunatic that I scanned to create the cover of the CD version of the game.  There's a similar picture of Bouapha, as you might guess.  It's not the most exciting drawing, or the best, but it's a piece of history!  On the actual CD cover, I used the line tools in Paint Shop Pro to smooth it all out, and in fact ended up making his hands more like mittens.  Check it out if you have a copy!"
drunk_armadillo.bmp,Drunk Armadillo,Hamumu,136,58,"It's a drunk armadillo, and possibly the coolest dinosaur I've ever drawn.  It looks so perfectly dopey!"
ducks.bmp,Ducks & A Dog,Hamumu,139,58,"I was drawing an assortment of ducks, including an angry one in a barrel (you would be angry too), and threw in a dog for good measure.  This was definitely doodling.  Sol Hunt did the coloring.  She likes to color."
eddie_g.bmp,Eddie Galaxy Notes II,Hamumu,103,55,"Some concepts of different enemies in Eddie Galaxy.  That game had such a short development cycle, you won't find any designs that didn't go in - there was no time to design anything but the essential!  Note: you can see some images through the paper here.  Can you recognize which other gallery picture was on the opposite side of this page?"
fatzah.bmp,Fat Kitty,Hamumu,131,46,Huzzah is a big fat tub.  He's on a special diet.  Here he looks like a cow caught in headlights!

Each weekend we produce a few more to keep up with demand and make sure we have some when orders come in (because making them individually is a lot of work!).  This is our first batch ever, 6 each of Stockboy, Loonyland, and the Dr. Lunatic Bundle."
infmouse.bmp,Inflatable Mouse,Hamumu,142,58,This is an apparently drugged inflatable mouse.
jungle.bmp,Jungle River Rafting,Hamumu,127,62,"Another Sol Hunt coloring job... of a Pygmy picture.  Don't know why I drew a Pygmy in the first place, but I felt like it!  The two weird things in the front are supposed to be marsh reed type things."
kid_myst_maps.bmp,Kid Mystic Maps,Hamumu,106,55,"Maps of some levels in Kid Mystic.  On the left is the Chapter IV overworld (or to be more precise, underworld).  The lower right one is the dreaded Vault, which has caused so many customer emails!  The actual solution to it is on this page as well!  The other one, I don't remember the name of, but you can find it yourself, I believe in Chapter III.  The notes in the lower left are sprite numbers for the Scarier Bat.  Notes like this are scattered by the dozens across all my notebooks.  It's how I keep track of which frames are which when I am taking a monster from the art program and putting it into the game."
killchars.bmp,Kill!,Hamumu,109,55,"When I was much younger and much less capable of actually getting anything done, my friends and I tried to make a fighting game.  It was kind of a spoof of Mortal Kombat, and definitely far more over the top (the blood spewed nonstop, pretty much!).  Of course, it required digitizing my friends into characters!  This shot shows off the characters (3 of which are the same actor).  I only remember the name of one: The Tourist."
laughing_dragon.bmp,Laughing Dragon,Hamumu,130,62,"To help out a friend, I worked on designs for a logo for his website, Laughing Dragon Entertainment.  This was one of them.  He looks like he has stomach cramps.  Of note is that you can almost see through the paper to an upside down big dragon head drawn on the back, from one of the other designs."
lawyer_slug.bmp,CSC 315 Notes,Hamumu,133,62,"This is what notes looked like during my college days.  There's some words!  Mainly this is in here to show the same thing that always happens: I doodle a shape, which turns into a character, and then that character seems to be something, so I label it as such.  Here we have the Lawyer Slug.  I always amuse myself with such things (after all, the only reason I write down the label is because I found the thought funny!), though my favorite is the Rocket-Powered Cult Leader.  Or maybe the Vampire In An Izod Turtleneck.  Those two can be found somewhere on our website, but not in this gallery.  Lots of axes on this page too."
mailing.bmp,Our First Shipment!,Hamumu,128,46,"Those big monkey paws there are holding our first ever shipment direct from Hamumu HQ.  The address has been smudged to protect the innocent (digitally... we didn't actually smear out the address, since that would have made shipping difficult).  It took most of a day to get the CD's prepped for shipping, but since then we have improved dramatically.  Don't you love our fancy mailing labels?  The package is puffy because it's a double order!  Hooray!"

noah.bmp,Noah's Ark,Hamumu,139,62,"A triptych I painted for my nephew's bedroom, which was of course done up in a Noah's Ark theme.  This was my first attempt at painting.  The hardest part was staying in the lines - that's where Sol Hunt came in.  She drew the nice straight, thick, marker lines!"
onion.bmp,The Diabolical Onion,Hamumu,142,62,"One day in a chat room, someone suggested we compete to draw the best picture that fits the description of ""The Diabolical Onion"".  I drew this.  I don't think I won, but then, I am pretty unsure if anyone else tried either.  Maybe it was all just a fevered delusion to begin with."

rocks.bmp,Garden Rocks,Hamumu,127,66,"This is a sketch of some rocks that were stacked up in our garden.  If you're wondering what the big round seed-shaped things are at the bottom, I drew a giant hamburger on the opposite side of the paper, and the scanner caught it."
small_tree.bmp,A Small Tree,Hamumu,130,66,"This is a tree that is small.  Sure, it looks big to you, but that's because it's zoomed in.  This wasn't much of a picture really, until Sol Hunt colored it.  Now I think it looks cool!"
space_lobster.bmp,Eddie Galaxy Notes,Hamumu,106,59,"The concept drawing of the Space Lobster in Eddie Galaxy, along with a few other things (like the Robospider), and an ocean of notes.  Sometimes I really don't know a week or two later what exactly the notes were talking about.  But they get the job done at the time!"
spaceboy.bmp,SpaceBoy,Hamumu,109,59,This is the drawing of SpaceBoy which I scanned to create the in-game picture you can see on our Gamelets page.  It's also a bunch of other doodles.  That's how I work!
spaceboy_guys.bmp,SpaceBoy Characters,Hamumu,109,62,"These are some of the characters envisioned for SpaceBoy.  It had a really interesting and involved multi-path storyline, but also, it had a guy who looked eerily like David Hyde-Pierce.  Well, he was never put in the game, but when I drew him, I thought that about him.  Molotov is actually the final boss you face in the demo that is on our Gamelets page."
spaceboy_old.bmp,SpaceBoy 1991?,Hamumu,115,59,"Long long ago, I started a game called SpaceBoy.  It's not the same as the one you see on our website.  It was in DOS!  And it was wacky!  It had some pretty hilarious (and inappropriate) quotes when you got blown up, including ""That didn't hit me!"""
spcdock.bmp,SpisHulk Spacedock,Hamumu,105,62,"This is a part of a game you've never played, called SPISPOPD VII: SpisHulk.  It's a long story.  But it was really cool!  You flew around in a spaceship, blowing up evil pumpkin spaceships, then had to blow open the hatch on a giant spaceship (a 'SpisHulk'), at which point you would go inside and engage in side-scrolling platform action with fighting game type moves.  It was neato, I thought.  But oh, so much to do.  It was a monster game."
spismallmap.bmp,Spismall Map,Hamumu,113,62,"This was the design for the layout of the Spismall.  You can also see exorbitant amounts of notes all around it.  I don't actually know what most of them are.  The cut off ones on the right are a list of graphics I needed to create for the mall, though.  Turned out pretty much just like this in the end, huh?"
spookymaps.bmp,Spooky Castle Maps,Hamumu,136,70,"I try to tell people I actually plan things out before I work.  This is proof!  These are maps from Spooky Castle: Bouapha!  The text on the side is a list of sprite numbers for Spooky Castle's title graphics, I believe.  The set of circles with arrows in them is a map of the Tower level in Spooky Castle.  Beneath that is Cobweb Central, and the other one is A Warm Bath, which seemed to undergo some changes after design.  That's what happens!"
sunflowers.bmp,Sunflower Cross-stitch,Sol Hunt,133,66,Sol Hunt stitched this all by herself!  It's really cool.
tech_stuff.bmp,The Machine,Hamumu,136,66,"This is a super detailed thing.  A fun project - I just started with a blank piece of paper and started drawing high tech looking things on it.  I spent half an hour a day doing that for a while, and this is the result.  It's still unfinished, but it's pretty cool looking.  Try it yourself - there's no way to screw up as long as you just keep adding more stuff!"
tomato_alien.bmp,Tomato Alien & Friends,Hamumu,127,70,"Doodling!  That alien is very tomato like.  The reason this picture is actually included is that I think a Riverdancin' Elf is amusing.  We also have a pair of scissors, a cultist teddy bear, a spaceship, and some weird shapes.  As usual, Sol Hunt colored my colorless drawings."
woods.bmp,The Woods,Hamumu,130,70,"A picture I sketched while reading a book about how to draw!  I probably copied it from one in the book (but it's not like I traced it, cut me some slack!).  Of course, Sol Hunt colored it, bringing life to my otherwise pointless picture.  Then she framed it with brown construction paper and put it on the wall.  We're classy like that."
workstation.bmp,The Dumb Factory,Hamumu,137,46,"This is where all the magic happens!  Note the purple chair, the omnipresent water bottle for constant hydration, the need to cover the printer with plastic to stop kitty hairs, the stack of CDs ready to be shipped out when ordered (next to the printer), the Nintendo poster, and of course the yearbook used as a mousepad.  It works well!  I'm not one of those people who works in the dark - we just had to close the blinds for the picture to come out.  I'm solar powered!  You can see another of the Gallery pictures in the background of this shot, framed above my collection of released games on the mantel (the two big ones are Kid Mystic and eGames 101 Collector's Edition)."
yerfdog.bmp,Yerfdog,Hamumu,133,70,"This is possibly the original Yerfdog!  It's not terribly well drawn, but the concept is simple: an inflatable dog.  He says Yerf."
zahnzazz.bmp,Awwww!,Hamumu,125,46,"These are my babies, Huzzah and Pizzazz.  We call them Zah and Zazzy for short.  They're a whole lot bigger than this now, but you just can't beat this picture.  Look, a Dreamcast controller in the background!"
zazzy.bmp,Sleepy Zazzy,Hamumu,122,46,"Look how cute!  She's a Scottish Fold, hence the folded ears."
zazzyatari.bmp,Zazzy Plays Pitfall 2,Hamumu,121,43,"My baby Zazzy is here deeply appreciating the intricacies of Pitfall 2.  Her ears are back because she's just about to pounce at the pitfall guy, because he really offends her."

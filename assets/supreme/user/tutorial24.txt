Pausing... exciting topic!  Any time you're playing, you can press the ESC
key or the Start gamepad button to pause the game.  But wait, there's 
more!  While it's paused you have several options you should know about:
Continue - back to gameplay!
Retry - starts the level over.  Use it if you get stuck!
Give Up - returns you to the world's Hub Level.
World Select - returns you all the way to the World Select screen.
Sound - Adjust the sound effect volume.
Music - Tweak music options from a wide variety of choices.
Quit Game - Hmm...
It sounds pretty trivial, but those are things you need to know
about while you're playing.  Now beat these Mumbles!
